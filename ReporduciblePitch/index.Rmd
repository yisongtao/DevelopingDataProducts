## Purpose of this app

- This app is developed for Developing Data Products Course Project.
- The app uses `mtcars` dataset in R `datasets` package, plots individual variables vs. Miles per Gallon (mpg) and demonstrates single variable regression model using mpg as outcome.
- The app is here: *https://yisongtao.shinyapps.io/DevelopingDataProducts*

## mtcars Dataset

- The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).
- The dataset is included in R 'datasets' package.

## Analysis Code
```
    formulaTextPoint <- reactive({
        paste("mpg ~", "as.numeric(", input$variable, ")")
    })
    fit <- reactive({
        lm(formulaText(), data=mtcars)
    })
    output$fitPlot <- renderPlot({
        with(mtcars, {
            plot(as.formula(formulaTextPoint()), xlab = formulaText(),
                 ylab = "Miles per Gallon",)
            abline(fit(), col=2)
        })
    })
```
